              Hello, I am <span className="green">Ibrahim Gazi</span>
            </h1>
            <p>
              <br />I worked as a Front-end Developer. I just want to share my
              starting journey as a web developer. To tell the truth, I never
              imagined introducing myself as a web developer. Because I just
              wanted to make a website for my office to keep track of our
              remaining bills. But with time a love for coding started to
              develop. Then I am serious about web development. I am constantly
              striving to improve myself as a Web developer. Last 2 Years I have
              become familiar with all the technologies of this stock. But now,
              I feel I am ready to do work internationally.
              <br />
              <br />I think Coding is not easy to learn for everyone ( Personal
              Opinion ). It was more difficult for me because I was a job
              holder. It requires a lot of persistence, willingness, and time to
              learn. Since I love coding so much I might end up doing this. It
              has now merged with my soul. eat, sleep, code, and repeat.“I don’t
              stop when I’m tired; I stop when I’m done.”
              <br />
              <br />
              Regards,
              <br />
